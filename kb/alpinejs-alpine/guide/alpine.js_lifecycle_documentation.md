# Alpine.js Lifecycle Documentation

**Summary:** This guide explores the various ways to hook into the Alpine.js component lifecycle. It covers initialization hooks like the `init()` method within `Alpine.data` or `x-data`, the `x-init` directive for element-specific setup, and the global `alpine:init` event for registering components or plugins. It also details reactivity hooks such as `$watch` for reacting to specific data changes and `x-effect` for effects dependent on reactive data, along with the `alpine:initialized` event that fires after Alpine finishes initializing the page.

## Defining init() Method in Alpine.data for Component Initialization

**Description:** Shows how to define an `init()` method within a reusable component created using `Alpine.data()`. This method serves as a constructor or initialization hook, automatically executing its code just before Alpine initializes each element that uses this component data (`x-data="dropdown"`). See also [[../api/alpine.js_x-data_directive_documentation.md#creating-reusable-components-with-alpinedata|Alpine.data]].

```javascript
// In your script, typically within an 'alpine:init' listener
Alpine.data('dropdown', () => ({
    init() {
        // Runs once per dropdown component instance, before Alpine processes its children.
        console.log('Dropdown component initializing...');
    },
    // other component properties...
}))
```

## Using x-effect Directive for Reactive State Tracking in Alpine.js

**Description:** Demonstrates `x-effect`, a directive that runs its expression immediately upon component initialization and then automatically re-runs whenever any reactive data properties accessed within that expression change. It's ideal for side effects that need to mirror reactive state. See also [[../api/alpine.js_x-effect_directive.md|x-effect]].

```html
<!-- Logs the value of 'open' initially and whenever 'open' changes -->
<div x-data="{ open: false }" x-effect="console.log('Current open state:', open)">
    <button @click="open = !open">Toggle</button>
</div>
```

## Using $watch Magic to Monitor Data Changes in Alpine.js

**Description:** Explains the `$watch` magic property, used to execute a callback function specifically when a particular data property changes. Unlike `x-effect`, `$watch` only runs *after* the change occurs and provides both the new and previous values to the callback. See also [[../misc/magic_properties_overview.md|$watch]].

```html
<!-- Logs the new value of 'open' only when it changes -->
<div x-data="{ open: false }" x-init="$watch('open', (newValue, oldValue) => console.log('Open changed from', oldValue, 'to', newValue))">
     <button @click="open = !open">Toggle</button>
</div>
```

---

## Using x-init Directive for Element Initialization in Alpine.js

**Description:** Demonstrates the `x-init` directive, which executes its JavaScript expression once, when Alpine initializes the specific element it's attached to. It can be used for element-specific setup tasks. See also [[../api/alpine.js_x-init_directive_documentation.md|x-init]].

```html
<!-- Logs a message when this specific button is initialized by Alpine -->
<button x-init="console.log('Button element initializing...')">Click Me</button>
```

## Hooking into Alpine.js Initialization with alpine:init Event

**Description:** Shows how to listen for the global `alpine:init` event on the `document`. This event fires once Alpine's core is loaded but *before* it starts initializing components on the page. It's the standard place to register reusable components (`Alpine.data`), custom directives (`Alpine.directive`), or custom magic properties (`Alpine.magic`).

```javascript
// Typically placed in a script tag before the closing </body> or in a bundled JS file
document.addEventListener('alpine:init', () => {
    console.log('Alpine core loaded, registering components...');
    Alpine.data('myComponent', () => ({ /* ... */ }));
    // Register other Alpine extensions here
})
```

---

## Using alpine:initialized Event in Alpine.js

**Description:** Demonstrates listening for the global `alpine:initialized` event. This event fires once Alpine has completely finished its initial pass of initializing all components on the page. It's useful for running code that needs to interact with fully initialized Alpine components.

```javascript
// Typically placed in a script tag before the closing </body> or in a bundled JS file
document.addEventListener('alpine:initialized', () => {
    console.log('Alpine has finished initializing all components on the page.');
    // Interact with initialized Alpine components here if needed
})
```
