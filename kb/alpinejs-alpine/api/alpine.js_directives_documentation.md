# Alpine.js Directives Documentation

**Summary:** This document outlines the metadata configuration used to structure and present the "Directives" section within the Alpine.js documentation. It specifies properties like display order, title, the common `x-` prefix for directives, and identifies this page as representing a sub-directory containing individual directive documentation files.

## Defining Alpine.js Directive Section Metadata

**Description:** This YAML frontmatter snippet defines configuration metadata for the overall "Directives" section in the Alpine.js documentation. It sets the display order, the section title, indicates the common `x-` prefix used for directives, suggests a monospaced font for display, and marks this as a container (`sub-directory`) for individual directive pages.

```markdown
---
order: 4
title: Directives
prefix: x-
font-type: mono
type: sub-directory
---
```
