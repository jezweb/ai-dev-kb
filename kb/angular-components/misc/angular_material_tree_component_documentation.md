## Implementing a Flat Tree Structure with mat-tree in Angular Material

**Description:** Example of a flat tree structure where nodes are rendered as siblings in sequence rather than nested within each other. This structure is easier to style and better for scrolling variations.

```html
<mat-tree>
  <mat-tree-node> parent node </mat-tree-node>
  <mat-tree-node> -- child node1 </mat-tree-node>
  <mat-tree-node> -- child node2 </mat-tree-node>
</mat-tree>
```

## Implementing a Nested Tree Structure with mat-tree in Angular Material

**Description:** Example of a nested tree structure where children nodes are placed inside their parent node in the DOM. This structure is better for visualizing hierarchical relationships.

```html
<mat-tree>
   <mat-nested-tree-node>
     parent node
     <mat-nested-tree-node> -- child node1 </mat-nested-tree-node>
     <mat-nested-tree-node> -- child node2 </mat-nested-tree-node>
   </mat-nested-tree-node>
</mat-tree>
```

## Implementing Node Activation Handlers in Angular Material Tree

**Description:** Setting up event handlers for both click and keyboard activation on tree nodes, allowing for consistent interaction regardless of input method.

```html
<mat-tree-node
    *matNodeDef="let node"
    (click)="performAction(node)"
    (activation)="performAction($event)">
</mat-tree-node>
```

## Creating Conditional Node Templates in Angular Material Tree

**Description:** Example of using multiple node templates with conditional rendering based on the 'when' predicate. This allows for specialized rendering of certain node types.

```html
<mat-tree-node *matNodeDef="let node" matTreeNodePadding>
  {{node.value}}
</mat-tree-node>
<mat-tree-node *matNodeDef="let node; when: isSpecial" matTreeNodePadding>
  [ A special node {{node.value}} ]
</mat-tree-node>
```

## Setting Up Tree with TrackBy Function in Angular Material

**Description:** Example of providing a trackBy function to a mat-tree to improve performance by helping Angular identify unique nodes across data changes.

```html
<mat-tree [dataSource]="dataSource" [treeControl]="treeControl" [trackBy]="trackByFn">
```
