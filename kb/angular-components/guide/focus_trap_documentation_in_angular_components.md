## Implementing Focus Trap with cdkTrapFocus in Angular HTML Template

**Description:** Demonstrates how to use the cdkTrapFocus directive to contain keyboard focus within a dialog element. The directive prevents Tab and Shift+Tab navigation from leaving the bounded element, which is essential for modal dialog accessibility.

```html
<div class="my-inner-dialog-content" cdkTrapFocus>
  <!-- Tab and Shift + Tab will not leave this element. -->
</div>
```
