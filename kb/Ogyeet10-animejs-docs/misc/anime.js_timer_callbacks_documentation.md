## Creating a Timer with Callbacks in Anime.js

**Description:** This snippet demonstrates how to create a timer using the createTimer() function in Anime.js, including various callback functions. The timer is set to run for 1000 milliseconds, use frame-based timing, and loop indefinitely.

```javascript
createTimer({
  duration: 1000,
  frameRate: true,
  loop: true,
  onBegin: () => {},
  onLoop: () => {},
  onUpdate: () => {},
});
```
