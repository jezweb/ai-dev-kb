## Creating and Managing Scope in Anime.js

**Description:** This JavaScript snippet demonstrates initializing a scope using 'createScope' in Anime.js. The 'scope' object contains properties and methods to manage DOM operations, constructor functions, media queries, and revertibles. Essential functions include getting default parameters, root elements, and media query matches. Dependencies include the Anime.js library version 4.0.0 or higher.

```javascript
const scope = createScope();
┌────────┐
scope.│methods │
scope.│root    ├─ Properties
scope.│matches │
└────────┘
```
