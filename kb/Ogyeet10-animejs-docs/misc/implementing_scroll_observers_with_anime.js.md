## Animating with ScrollObserver in Anime.js - JavaScript

**Description:** This JavaScript snippet uses Anime.js to animate elements based on scroll events. It utilizes the ScrollObserver to define callbacks that are triggered at certain scroll positions. The snippet requires Anime.js and targets elements within a specified container on the y-axis. It supports multiple callbacks for handling enter, leave, and update events.

```JavaScript
animate('.square', {
  x: 100,
  autoplay: onScroll({
    container: '.container',
    target: '.section',
    axis: 'y',
    enter: 'bottom top',
    leave: 'top bottom',
    sync: true,
    onEnter: () => {},
    onLeave: () => {},
    onUpdate: () => {}
  })
});
```
