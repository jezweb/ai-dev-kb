## Implementing Basic Constructor DI in Angular Component

**Description:** Demonstrates how to inject a service (PetCareService) into a component using constructor-based dependency injection. The private keyword is used to automatically create a class property from the constructor parameter.

```typescript
@Component({...})
class PetCarDashboardComponent {
    constructor(private petCareService: PetCareService) {
        ...
    }
}
```
