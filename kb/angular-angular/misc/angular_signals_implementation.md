## Creating and Updating Writable Signals in Angular

**Description:** This snippet demonstrates how to create a writable signal using the signal() function and update its value using the set() and update() methods. The signal holds a counter value that can be directly replaced or updated based on its current state.

```typescript
const counter = signal(0);

counter.set(2);
counter.update(count => count + 1);
```
