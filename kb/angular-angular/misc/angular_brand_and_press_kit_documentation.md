## Custom Card Container Structure in Markdown

**Description:** Markdown structure for displaying downloadable Angular logo assets and brand guidelines using custom docs-card-container and docs-card components.

```markdown
<docs-card-container>
  <docs-card title="Angular logos" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IgcAwLDVZUz8ycnFa7T4_H6B4V4LhYUQ?usp=sharing" link="Download from Google Drive">
    ![Angular wordmark gradient logo](assets/images/press-kit/angular_wordmark_gradient.png "Angular wordmark gradient logo")
    ![Angular wordmark white logo](assets/images/press-kit/angular_wordmark_white.png "Angular wordmark white logo")
    ![Angular wordmark black logo](assets/images/press-kit/angular_wordmark_black.png "Angular wordmark black logo")
    Black and white are the default color variations and should be used in most circumstances. A gradient version of the icon and lockup is available in both static and animated formats and can be used in cases where a color icon is required.

    Our brand guidelines folders contain the design files, guidance and community examples for how the brand can be adapted.
