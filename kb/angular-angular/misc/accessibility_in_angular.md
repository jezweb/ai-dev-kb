## Using ARIA attribute binding in Angular templates

**Description:** Demonstrates the proper syntax for binding to ARIA attributes in Angular templates using the attr. prefix, which is necessary because ARIA relies on HTML attributes rather than DOM properties.

```html
<!-- Use attr. when binding to an ARIA attribute -->
<button [attr.aria-label]="myActionLabel">â€¦</button>
```
