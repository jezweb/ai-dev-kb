## Snippet: Simulating a Quantum Circuit in Qiskit
Description: Shows how to simulate a quantum circuit using Qiskit's Aer simulator. The code creates a quantum circuit with Hadamard and CNOT gates, simulates it for multiple shots, and displays the measurement results.
Source: https://github.com/MichaelCade/90DaysOfDevOps/blob/main/template_repository/day12.md#2025-04-17_snippet_2
Language: python

```python
from qiskit import Aer, transpile, execute
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram

# Get the Aer simulator backend
simulator = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')

# Execute the circuit on the simulator
job = execute(qc, simulator, shots=1000)

# Get the results
result = job.result()

# Get the counts (measurement outcomes)
counts = result.get_counts(qc)

# Print the measurement outcomes
print(counts)

# Plot a histogram of the results
plot_histogram(counts)
```

## Snippet: Implementing Quantum Teleportation in Qiskit
Description: A complete implementation of the quantum teleportation protocol using Qiskit. This code creates a circuit with three qubits, initializes a state to be teleported, and demonstrates the complete teleportation process with necessary quantum gates and measurements.

Language: python

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram
import numpy as np

# Create a quantum circuit with 3 qubits and 2 classical bits
qc = QuantumCircuit(3, 2)

# Prepare the state to teleport (on qubit 0)
qc.x(0)  # Let's teleport |1âŸ©. You can change this to any state preparation.

# Create entanglement between qubits 1 and 2
qc.h(1)
qc.cx(1, 2)

# Bell measurement on qubits 0 and 1
qc.cx(0, 1)
qc.h(0)
qc.measure([0, 1], [0, 1])

# Apply corrections to qubit 2 based on measurement results
qc.z(2).c_if(0, 1)  # Apply Z if qubit 0 was measured as 1
qc.x(2).c_if(1, 1)  # Apply X if qubit 1 was measured as 1

# Draw the circuit
qc.draw()
```
